# BitCoin-Price-Tracker

Creation Date: March 2021

I made this website when I was first getting invested in Bitcoin. This website simply tracks the current price of Bitcoin. At the time I couldn't find any crypto app that would let me set my own limits to sell/buy. I would have to constantly keep checking the price. So just made it easier for me.

This is a static website that uses API to update the price. The graph doesn't show much when you first open the page since it doesn't have a lot of data to work with. If you let it run for a while the graph will update. You can set a reminder to remind you if the price falls under a certain value or goes over a certain value. 

The fact that this website is static, you would need to keep it running in the background for it to work properly.
